This project is a “Coming Soon” or “Under Maintenance” webpage with a countdown timer, a custom message, and a styled design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features

	•	Countdown Timer: The page includes a countdown timer that displays the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds until a specified launch date.
	•	Responsive Design: The page is designed to be responsive and adapts to different screen sizes (via a viewport meta tag and external styles).
	•	Custom Font: The webpage uses the Poppins font from Google Fonts for a modern and sleek look.
	•	Images: Logo and rocket images are used to enhance the design.
	•	JavaScript Countdown: A JavaScript script calculates the time remaining until the launch date and updates the countdown in real-time.

Files

	•	index.html: The main structure of the web page.
	•	style.css: The CSS file that contains the styles for the page (not included in this README).
	•	images/: A folder containing the logo, rocket, and other image assets used in the design.

How It Works

	1.	HTML Structure: The page uses a container with an image (logo) and a content section that includes a countdown timer and a “Learn More” button. The rocket image is placed near the bottom as part of the design.
	2.	CSS Styling: The styles are linked in style.css (make sure this file exists and is correctly set up) and include custom fonts, layout styles, and animations.
	3.	JavaScript Timer:
	•	The timer uses JavaScript to calculate the time difference between the current time and the target launch date (Sept 15, 2024 14:00:00).
	•	It updates every second to reflect the time remaining until launch.
	•	If the countdown reaches zero, the timer stops.
